## What is Pulse?

Pulse wraps AI agents in a **gated delivery chain**. Every decision is locked before planning starts. Every plan is approved before code is written. Every bead of work is verified before it's closed. Every feature is reviewed before it merges.

Without this structure, agents skip steps. With it, they can't.

Pulse ships as a **skills package**. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file loaded into context at invocation. The workflow contract lives in those skill files, while repo-local Node helpers handle onboarding, state sync, dependency checks, and local coordination. There is no separate orchestration service to deploy. Pulse is a docs-first skill plugin that uses the tools you already have.

## The Delivery Chain

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/delivery-chain.png" alt="Pulse delivery chain showing preflight, using-pulse, brainstorming, exploring, planning, validating, swarming, executing, reviewing, and compounding with Gates 1-4 approvals." width="1100" />
</p>

Pulse turns a vague request into a reviewed delivery trail:

1. `pulse:exploring` locks decisions into `CONTEXT.md`
2. `pulse:planning` turns those decisions into phases, contracts, story maps, and beads
3. `pulse:validating` checks that the current phase is actually safe to execute
4. `pulse:swarming` or `pulse:executing` implements the work
5. `pulse:reviewing` blocks weak merges
6. `pulse:compounding` captures durable learnings for future work

### The 4 Human Gates

| Gate | What it blocks |
| --- | --- |
| **Gate 1** | Planning before decisions are locked |
| **Gate 2** | Phase prep before the plan is approved |
| **Gate 3** | Execution before the current phase is validated |
| **Gate 4** | Merge before review is complete |

## Why use pulse

| Problem | Pulse response |
| --- | --- |
| Requirements drift inside chat | Lock decisions in `CONTEXT.md` |
| Plans look plausible but are brittle | Validate before execution starts |
| Parallel agents step on each other | Coordinate through beads, `bv`, and reservations |
| Work is hard to audit later | Keep artifacts, evidence, and review trail in the repo |

## Lineage

Pulse is downstream of everal strong agentic-development systems and distills the parts that fit this repo owner's actual workflow:

- **[Khuym](https://github.com/hoangnb24/skills/tree/main)**, which provides most of the validate-first chain and Flywheel-style bead workflow
- **[Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)**, which contributes the strongest behavioral discipline around brainstorming, verification, debugging, and skill design
- **[Flywheel](https://agent-flywheel.com/complete-guide)** contributes the operational backbone: beads, `bv`, swarm execution, and the habit of turning plans into live work graphs instead of loose TODO lists.
- **[Compound Engineering](https://github.com/EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin)** contributes parallel review, severity-based findings, and the compound-learning loop that feeds future work.
- **[GSD](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)** contributes the philosophy: discuss first, research second, plan third, and do not execute until the plan has been verified.

## Installation

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add quanpersie2001/pulse
/plugin install pulse@pulse
```

### Codex

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add quanpersie2001/pulse
```

Codex reads the marketplace name from [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json), so the installed plugin key is `pulse@pulse-dev`. In the desktop app, enable or install `pulse` from the `pulse-dev` marketplace if it is not already active after the marketplace add step.

If you previously added an older Pulse marketplace named `pulse`, remove it before reinstalling:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace remove pulse
```

### After Install

Installing the plugin makes the packaged skills, hooks, and MCP metadata available to the runtime. To use Pulse inside a target repository, start with `pulse:preflight` so Pulse can verify or install the repo-local onboarding assets it needs under `.pulse/`.

## Maintainer Notes

When public docs or skill metadata change:

```bash
bash scripts/check-markdown-links.sh
bash scripts/sync-skills.sh --dry-run
```

Run evaluations through the canonical entrypoint:

```bash
node scripts/pulse-plugin-eval.mjs run
```
