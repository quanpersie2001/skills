description: Capture durable learnings from completed Pulse work so future planning improves over time. Runs pattern/decision/failure analysis, synthesizes one learnings file, and routes learnings by propagation taxonomy (global-critical, correction, ratchet, bead-local, planner-only).

# Compounding

If `.pulse/onboarding.json` is missing or stale for the current repo, stop and invoke `pulse:using-pulse` before continuing.

Compounding turns completed feature work into reusable memory for future planning and execution.

## When to Use

- after `pulse:reviewing` completes and feature is merged
- after systematic bug-fix work reveals non-obvious root cause
- after abandoned work that produced reusable lessons

Skip only when no durable/reusable learning emerged.

## Runtime Contract

All operational rules live in `references/runtime-appendix.md`. Treat that file as canonical for:

- 3-stream analysis (pattern/decision/failure)
- synthesis quality bar (`applicable-when` must be specific)
- propagation taxonomy and routing destinations
- promotion rules for `critical-patterns.md`
- durable memory capture behavior in `.pulse/memory/*`
- state updates and handoff outputs

## Minimum Flow

1. Gather context from history artifacts, verification evidence, and bead graph.
2. Run three analysis streams and collect outputs.
3. Synthesize one learnings file at `.pulse/memory/learnings/YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md`.
4. Classify each learning by propagation type and route to destination.
5. Promote only truly global-critical learnings.
6. Update `.pulse/STATE.md` and `.pulse/state.json`.
