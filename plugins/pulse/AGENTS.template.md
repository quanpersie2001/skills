# Pulse Workflow

Use `pulse:using-pulse` first in this repo unless you are resuming an already approved Pulse handoff.

## What Pulse Is / Is Not

Pulse is a validate-first, docs-first skill workflow for Claude Code and Codex.
Pulse is not a license to skip `CONTEXT.md`, validating, review gates, or human approval.

## One-Line Glossary

- `CONTEXT.md` — locked decisions downstream work must honor.
- `phase-plan.md` — the whole-feature slice plan.
- phase contract — the current phase's proof and exit conditions.
- story map — the reason beads are sequenced the way they are.
- bead — one worker-sized unit of work with exact files and checks.
- handoff — the pause/resume contract for the next actor.
- `pulse_status` — the read-only scout for current workflow state.

## Startup

1. Read this file at session start and again after any context compaction.
2. If `.pulse/onboarding.json` is missing or outdated, stop and run `pulse:using-pulse` before continuing.
3. If `.codex/pulse_status.mjs` exists, use `node .codex/pulse_status.mjs --json` for a fast read-only status snapshot.
4. If `.pulse/handoffs/manifest.json` exists, do not auto-resume. Surface the saved state and wait for user confirmation.
5. If `.pulse/memory/critical-patterns.md` exists, read it before planning or execution work.

## Chain

```
pulse:preflight
  → pulse:using-pulse
  → pulse:exploring
  → pulse:planning
  → pulse:validating
  → pulse:swarming
  → pulse:executing
  → pulse:reviewing
  → pulse:compounding
```

## Critical Rules

1. Never execute without validating.
2. `CONTEXT.md` is the source of truth for locked decisions.
3. If context usage passes roughly 65%, write `.pulse/handoffs/manifest.json` and pause cleanly.
4. Treat `.pulse/state.json` as the routing mirror and `.pulse/STATE.md` as the human-readable narrative; keep them aligned.
5. After compaction, re-read `AGENTS.md`, run `node .codex/pulse_status.mjs --json` if present, then re-open `.pulse/handoffs/manifest.json`, `.pulse/state.json`, `.pulse/STATE.md`, and the active feature context before more work.
6. P1 review findings block merge.

## 3-Plane Model

1. **Control plane — `.pulse/`**: live workflow state, routing mirrors, handoffs, and operator surfaces.
2. **Memory plane — `.pulse/memory/`**: shared root for reusable cross-feature memory, including critical patterns, learnings, corrections, and ratchet artifacts.
3. **Feature record plane — `history/`**: feature-specific decisions, plans, contracts, story maps, and durable narrative.

## Operator Cookbook

### Startup scout

1. Run `pulse:using-pulse` if onboarding is missing or stale.
2. Run `node .codex/pulse_status.mjs --json` when available.
3. Use the scout to choose the next artifact instead of opening everything at once.

### Resume scout

- If `.pulse/handoffs/manifest.json` exists, surface it and wait for explicit confirmation.
- Re-open the handoff plus `.pulse/state.json` and `.pulse/STATE.md` before continuing.
- If current state and a handoff disagree, surface the mismatch instead of guessing.

### Swarm vs single-worker

- Use swarm when the current phase has enough parallelizable beads to justify coordination overhead.
- Use single-worker when Pulse discipline is still needed but parallelism is not.
- Gate 3 still blocks both modes until validating approves execution.

## Codex Guardrails

- Repo-local `.codex/` files installed by Pulse are workflow guardrails, not optional decoration.
- Use `node .codex/pulse_status.mjs --json` as the preferred quick scout step when it is available.
- Treat `compact_prompt` recovery instructions as mandatory.
- Use `bv` only with `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches the TUI and should be avoided in agent sessions.
- If the repo is only partially onboarded, stay in bootstrap/planning mode and surface what is missing before implementation.

## Session Finish

Before ending a substantial Pulse work chunk:

1. Update or close the active bead/task if one exists.
2. Leave `.pulse/state.json`, `.pulse/STATE.md`, and `.pulse/handoffs/` consistent with the current pause/resume state.
3. Mention any remaining blockers, open questions, or next actions in the final response.
